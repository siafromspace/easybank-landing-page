## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- I learnt how to edit svgs.
- I learnt out to create my own media queries with Tailwind CSS.
- I learnt more on positioning elements.

### Continued development

Working with Tailwind Css was a bit challenging so it is something I will like to work with more in the future to enable me get more fluent at it.

### Useful resources

- Tailwind CSS docs.
- Stack Overflow
